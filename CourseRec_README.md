# Course Recommendations Training Document.Rmd

This was a project I built from scratch at work, where I created a Netflix style recommendation algorithm where instead of recommending TV
shows and movies based on what TV shoves and movies were watched by a user, I recommended courses for students based on the courses they
took and their similarity to students who have taken the same courses as them. It utilizes both item based collaborative filtering 
as well as user based collaborative filtering. This specific markdown file is a training document that I created as well to teach
others how to use and run the algorithm themselves.
